##How it's done##

####What I will be using to build my portfolio:####

- [GitHub][4] Allows me to build a static website and it hosts it for free. It manages any changes I make to the site without overwriting & it keeps a history of all the changes I make.
- [Grunt][5] is a task-based command line build tool for Javascript projects
- [MarkdownPad2][6] to write my text files in Makrdown format
- [Ghost][1] is where I found my starter Blogging Template
- [Imgur][7] I'll use for hosting/sharing image files and 
- [Vimeo][8] for hosting/sharing movie files
