###Excitement!###

 ... so hard to sketch an excited person as  the entire action happens in such a quick amount of time. There are so many various ways in which excitement is expressed but it is often hard to find a real life person modeling you their excited pose. So .... the trusty internet to the rescue ... let's look up some "excited" images.

It could be just my imagination but (with genuine excitement, not asked to pose) it seems kids often pull "inward" when excited, they pull their hands/arms and/or objects near their body and especially their faces as if they can't believe what just happened. 

The most extreme sincere "outward" excited poses are often found in sports right after the winning point is scored. It seems the outward motion of  excitement comes from self confidence, they go in believing they can win and the outward excitement is an explosion of confirmation and built up energy.

Even after studying several images next to each other it seems that even in the adult world "hands to the face" expresses "I can't believe it" while fist pumps seem to translate "yes, I knew I could do it !" .
