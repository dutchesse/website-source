##Week 2 - Model a Chair in [Rhino][1]##

Our weapon of choice for this paper will be software called [Rhinoceros][1]. I have played with it a little over the summer break. It's promising .... fels like Sketchup on steroids. It started out as software created for the Yachting industry but over the years it has evolved and lends itself well to organic modeling. It appears to be a favorite amongst jewelry makers.
