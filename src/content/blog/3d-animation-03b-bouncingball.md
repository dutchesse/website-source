#Intro to 3D Animation#
##Week 3 - Bouncing a ball, not as easy as it sounds##

**First step, getting the ball to bounce up/down**   
- Create a sphere  
- Set time line to 100/100  
- move to starting point > select key frame 1, hit "s"  
- move ball up > select key frame 12, hit "s"   
- move ball down > select key frame 24, hit "s"  
- move ball up > select key frame 36, hit "s"   
- move ball down > select key frame 48, hit "s"   
- move ball up > select key frame 60, hit "s"   
- move ball down > select key frame 72, hit "s"   
- move ball up > select key frame 84, hit "s"   
- move ball down > select key frame 96, hit "s"    

Make sure the time line is set to playback speed "real Time". Hit play and you'll see the ball move up and down.

**Second step, getting the ball to move from left to right while bouncing**  
- Window > Animation Editors > Graph Editor  
- Re-size window, hit F to center entire graph
- Select "Translate Y" to control the up/down motion

Select last frame > move the ball over to the right as far as you want it to go and set key again.
Now ball moves form left to right.

Great now I have a basic ball moving up/down & left/right. Just need to make it more natural by studying some ball bounce reference movies.
