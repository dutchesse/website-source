###Amplifier###

These shapes appealed the most to me. It is obvious I like organic surfaces and things with holes in them I guess.
Out of these we are to create 15 iteration sketches  to see if we can make an improved version

Amplifier = a person or thing that amplifies or enlarges.  
Iteration =  exploring a different form of something.
