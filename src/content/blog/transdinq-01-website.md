##What I am looking for##

There is a small change of plan ...
Having 4 papers this semester, time is a precious commodity. After some web cruising for layout ideas, I stumbled upon a blogging platform site called [ghost][1]. Similar to WordPress but as the creator explains "just for blogging". As I like [the ideals][2] of this not-for-profit company, not to mention I get to escape the elementary world of Tumblr. I purchased the template [Dragonfly][3] so I have access to it's HTML/CSS.

Ghost has many free and low cost templates and yet again, here I found several templates of which certain items appeal to me, just not all neatly packaged into one, so .... I will start out with a template that struck me the most and will attempt to see if I can change it over time to create "my" perfect template.

I am always drawn to either Sepia/Brown or Dark Grey/light color schemes.
Call me boring but I find they have something soothing, especially for the eyes. The stark white backgrounds gibe me a headache. On this particular site the clouds slowly drift from right to left.

#####Dragonfly#####

What I like about the Dragonfly template is the image and static text and the blog listing blocks. Every Paper will have it's own blog page with an appropriate static image and text on the left.

#####Glampagne#####

What I like about the Glampagne template is the neatly stacked squares. As I intend to create a page & blog for each individual Uni paper, I imagine having it nice and neatly ordered with a picture, will make it easy to find previous blogs.
