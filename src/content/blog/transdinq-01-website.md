##World of websites##

There is a small change of plan ...
Having 4 papers this semester, time is a precious commodity. After some web cruising for layout ideas, I stumbled upon a blogging platform site called [ghost][1]. Similar to WordPress but as the creator explains "just for blogging". As I like [the ideals][2] of this not-for-profit company, not to mention I get to escape the elementary world of Tumblr. I purchased the template [Dragonfly][3] so I have access to the HTML/CSS

Ghost has many templates and yet again, here I found several templates of which certain items appeal to me, just not all neatly packaged into one, so .... I will start out with a template that struck me the most and will attempt by playing around to see if I can change it over time to create "my" perfect template.

What I like about the Dragonfly template is the image and static text on the left and the blocks on the right. Every Paper will have it's own page with an image and text associated. 
#####Glampagne#####

What I like about the Glampagne template is the neatly stacked squares. As I intend to create a page & blog for each individual Uni paper, I imagine having it nice and neatly ordered with a picture, will make it easy to find previous blogs.
