###Story Telling###

The team got together again this morning. After Maggie's comments yesterday we all felt empty again. This happens every time we talk with certain faculty members; we finally cook up an idea around the given Studio Theme only to have it shattered as being too predictable or too assumable, which in turns means all ideas supporting the initial idea are unhinged as well (no wonder we all end up with blank faces after such a session).  

My main struggle so far with storytelling is that that as a group we have plenty of ideas ... it just always seems to be missing something ... "something" that makes me want to read a book or watch a movie. We never seem to be able to come up with a complete the story. 

I searched to see if I could discover the art of Story telling and ran into this TED video by Film maker Andrew Stanton ("Toy Story," "WALL-E") In this video he shares what he knows about storytelling â€” starting at the end and working back to the beginning. I think he had some great remarks and what struck me as well is that it took them a year to come up with the story for Toy Story. These blockbusters simply do not get made within 4 weeks. <http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_stanton_the_clues_to_a_great_story>. 

Ann Marie mentioned trees and happy thoughts. I remember we had a short story book  titled "The giving tree" by Shel Silverstein. I brought it in with the idea that we perhaps could re-tell an existing story but put our own spin on it. We toyed around with that idea and searched to see if we could find such a story but to no avail. So in the end we came back to our "Ghost of place" theme that we all connected to.
